**Description:** A tool to generate README files automatically using AI.

## Overview

MyProject is a Python-based command-line tool and web application that leverages the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automatically generate comprehensive and well-structured README files for your projects. It takes project information (description, language, dependencies, etc.) and utilizes the OpenAI API (or other specified AI models) to craft a README that effectively communicates your project's purpose, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and contribution information.

This tool is designed to save developers time and effort by automating the often tedious task of writing a clear and informative README, leading to better project documentation and improved collaboration.

## Features

*   **AI-Powered Generation:** Uses AI models to generate README content based on project details.
*   **Customizable Generation:** Allows users to provide specific information and preferences to guide the README generation process.
*   **Command-Line Interface (CLI):**  Offers a convenient command-line tool for generating README files from the terminal.
*   **Web Application Interface:** Provides a user-friendly web interface built with Flask for generating README files.
*   **Template Support:**  Supports customizable templates to influence the style and structure of the generated README.
*   **Supports Multiple Languages:**  Can generate READMEs in various languages (English by default, but easily extendable).
*   **Dependency Detection:** (Planned)  Automatically detects project dependencies and includes them in the installation instructions.

## Installation

To install MyProject, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/MyProject.git
    cd MyProject
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    The `requirements.txt` file contains the following dependencies:

    *   `Flask`
    *   `OpenAI`
    *   `python-dotenv` (for managing API keys securely)
    *   `requests`
    *   `any other specific libraries used`

4.  **Configure your OpenAI API Key:**

    *   Obtain an API key from the OpenAI platform (https://platform.openai.com/).
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
    *   Add the following line to the `.env` file, replacing `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY` with your actual API key:

        ```
        OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
        ```

    **Important:**  Do *not* commit your `.env` file to version control.  Add it to your `.gitignore` file.

## Usage

MyProject can be used through both a command-line interface (CLI) and a web application.

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

1.  **Run the CLI tool:**

    ```bash
    python myproject/cli.py --project-name "Your Project Name" --description "A brief description of your project." --language "Python" --output "README.md"
    ```

    **Options:**

    *   `--project-name`:  The name of your project (required).
    *   `--description`:  A short description of your project (required).
    *   `--language`: The programming language used in your project (required).
    *   `--output`:  The filename for the generated README file (defaults to `README.md`).
    *   `--template`:  Path to a custom README template file (optional).
    *   `--model`:  Specify the OpenAI model to use (defaults to `gpt-3.5-turbo`).

2.  **Example with all options:**

    ```bash
    python myproject/cli.py --project-name "My Awesome Library" --description "A library for performing complex calculations." --language "Python" --output "README.md" --template "templates/custom_template.md" --model "gpt-4"
    ```

### Web Application

1.  **Run the Flask application:**

    ```bash
    python myproject/app.py
    ```

2.  **Access the application in your browser:**

    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` (or the address displayed in the terminal).

3.  **Fill in the project details form:**

    Enter the project name, description, language, and any other relevant information in the provided form.

4.  **Click the "Generate README" button:**

    The application will use the provided information and the OpenAI API to generate a README file.

5.  **Download the generated README:**

    A download link will be provided to download the generated README file.
