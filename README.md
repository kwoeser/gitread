### Getting Started üöÄ
This section provides instructions on how to get the project up and running on your local machine.

**Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   Python (3.6 or higher recommended)
*   `pip` (Python package installer)
*   Node.js and npm 
*   A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

**Installation**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kwoeser/gitread.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd gitread
    ```

3.  **Set up Python environment** (using virtualenv, venv, or conda, for example).  It is highly recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies. Examples:

    *   Using `venv`:

        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
        venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
        ```

    *   Using `virtualenv`:

        ```bash
        pip install virtualenv
        virtualenv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
        venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
        ```

4.  **Install Python Dependencies:**

    Install the necessary Python packages. Usually, this is done by using a `requirements.txt` file. If there is one:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    If there isn't a `requirements.txt` file, you'll need to inspect the project and install each dependency manually using `pip install <package-name>`.

5.  **Frontend Dependencies (If applicable):**

    If the project utilizes a frontend framework like React, Vue, or Angular, it likely requires Node.js and npm (or yarn). Ensure these are installed.
    If there's a `package.json` file in a frontend directory, navigate to that directory and run:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

### Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

This section describes any necessary configuration steps. These will vary substantially based on the project's specific requirements.

1.  **Environment Variables:**

    The project may rely on environment variables for configuration. Check the project for any `.env` files or documentation detailing the required environment variables. Common examples include API keys, database connection strings, and other sensitive information.

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory (if one doesn't already exist) and populate it with the necessary key-value pairs:

    ```
    FLASK_ENV=development
    FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
    GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
    GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
    ```

    **Note:** It is crucial to *never* commit `.env` files to a public repository. Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file.

2.  **Backend Configuration**

    If a backend server is present and needs configured, there will be configuration files related to it. Please refer to the backend implementation to configure the application.

### Usage üíª

Instructions for running the application after installation.

1.  **Start the backend (Python):**

    If the project has a Python backend, run the main application file. For example:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

    Or, if using a framework like Flask or Django, follow the framework-specific instructions to start the server (e.g., `flask run` or `python manage.py runserver`).

2.  **Start the frontend (React):**

    If the project has a React frontend, navigate to the frontend directory and start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

3.  **Access the application:**

    Once both the frontend and backend servers are running, access the application in your web browser by navigating to the appropriate address. The exact address will depend on the configuration of your frontend server.
