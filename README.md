## Usage

1.  Start the development server:

    ```

    This will start the development server, and you can view the website in your browser at the address provided by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

2.  Build the project for production:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This will create a `dist` directory containing the optimized build files for deployment.

3.  Lint the code:

    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```

    This will run the ESLint linter to check for code quality issues.

4.  Preview the built project:

    ```bash
    npm run preview
    ```
    This will serve the built project locally, allowing you to preview the production build.
